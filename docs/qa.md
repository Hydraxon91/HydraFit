# HydraFit — Device QA Checklist

Manual acceptance pass before tagging a release. Run on a clean install of the signed release
APK (an emulator is fine; the AGENTS UI-verification rules keep automated runs off a personal
phone). Tabs: **Equipment · Fatigue · Plan · Log · Routines · Settings**.

Legend: each item is a step → expected result. Note failures with the tab, the action, and the
exact on-screen text.

## 0. Launch & shell
- Cold start → no crash, 5 tabs present in the expected order.
- Background/foreground and rotation → state survives, no ANR.
- Fresh install → empty states are coherent (no plan, no logs, no records).

## 1. Equipment
- Add custom equipment, rename it, set a max weight, delete it → selection updates; survives relaunch.
- Search filters the exercise list; built-in tags present.

## 2. Exercise catalog (Equipment → edit)
- Edit a built-in: equipment, movement pattern, per-muscle involvement tiers, unilateral flag → Save, reopen, values persisted.
- Movement-pattern picker now groups **Compound** and **Accessory** and shows the hint that accessory patterns use the accessory set count. Selecting an accessory pattern (e.g. Core, Biceps isolation) yields the accessory set count in a plan.
- Reset restores defaults; add/edit/delete a custom exercise; deleting one referenced by a logged set is blocked.
- **Load capability (EX-02):** the editor's Load row offers External weight / Bodyweight / Bodyweight + added. `Ab Roll` shows Bodyweight selected; `Back Squat` shows External weight; `Pull-up` shows Bodyweight + added. Saving persists and survives relaunch (built-in edits go through the override).
- **Catalog profile suggestions (CAT-02; emulator verification pending):** New exercise → enter
  Pullup/Chinup or Langhantel-Bankdrücken/Kurzhantel-Bankdrücken → Find profile → Suggested catalog
  profile shows effective equipment/pattern, exact muscle weights, load and unilateral flag. All
  approved languages work regardless of UI locale. Existing-edit dialogs do not offer Find profile.
- Rename a built-in → its canonical name, new display name and approved alias still find the same
  effective profile. Give two built-ins the same effective display name → Find requires an explicit
  chooser with names/equipment/identity labels; never automatically selects one. Unknown, partial,
  blank or separator-only names do not populate fields.
- Manually interact with each of the five groups (including default values or toggling back) → its
  preview checkbox starts unchecked; untouched groups start checked. Toggle preview checks → editor
  values/protection remain unchanged until Apply selected. Uncheck all → Apply disabled.
- Apply a subset → only those groups change, muscle weights replace the whole map, name stays the
  user's, no exercise is saved. Find again → applied groups remain unchecked/protected. Name edit
  invalidates the preview without discarding values/protection. Preview Cancel changes neither;
  creation Cancel persists nothing and reopening starts fresh. Legacy/unspecified is displayed
  honestly and is not converted to External weight.
- Save a canonical seeded name or its whitespace/case variant → localized choose-a-distinct-name-or-
  cancel guidance. Non-colliding approved alias/translation names save as separate custom identities;
  their related records remain on their custom IDs across startup. Existing advisory guardrails and
  normal Save validation still apply. No suggestions copy prescriptions/history/preferences/PRs.

## 3. Plan — deterministic
- Days 2–6 resolve to the right split (2–3 Full Body, 4 Upper-Lower, 5–6 PPL); per-day focus labels correct.
- **No repeat regression:** a compound exercise must not appear on two different days, even when those days share a movement pattern (e.g. a 3-day Full Body plan). If no alternative compound exists for a shared pattern, the day simply omits it rather than repeating.
- Accessories may repeat only when no fresh alternative exists.
- Use this plan → persists; Plan history shows the entry; Delete removes it; Regenerate only enables when inputs change.
- Week 4 shows the deload banner; suggested weights appear when history/sharing exists.
- Airplane mode → deterministic plan still generates.

## 4. Plan — Gemini (typed failure reasons)
- No API key → Gemini is unavailable in Settings.
- Valid key → **plan generates** (this was the pre-fix failure: the response schema now constrains `exerciseId` to the catalog, so a valid-but-unknown id can no longer collapse a day and force a fallback). If the model still returns names, they are resolved by name.
- Blank/cleared key with Gemini selected → shows an API-key reason (not a generic message).
- Rate limit (429) → "rate-limiting" reason; retries up to twice.
- Daily quota (429, per-day) → "quota" reason and **no retry**.
- Service 5xx → "temporarily unavailable" reason + Retry.
- Airplane mode with Gemini selected → "couldn't reach" / timeout reason.
- Any failure → the specific localized reason is shown, with the raw backend detail underneath.
- Sharing toggle OFF → no weight history sent (consent gate); ON changes behaviour.

## 5. Plan — on-device LLM
- No model imported → the engine is greyed out in Settings.
- Import the portable pack (`gemma3-1b-it-int4.litertlm`) → generation starts on GPU/CPU; a plan is produced or a reason is logged.
- **Recovery regression:** after a failed generation or a model change, tapping generate again must not fail with "Engine is not initialized" — the generator drops the stale engine instead of caching a closed one.
- NPU pack (`…_sm8850.litertlm`) → import is refused with the "NPU model packs aren't supported" message; the hint/link that used to point at these packs is gone. A pre-existing NPU install shows "NPU build (unsupported)" and the on-device engine stays unavailable; if reached, the generator still tries NPU → GPU → CPU and falls back with a clear log line.
- If the on-device plan is rejected, logcat (`adb logcat -s LiteRtLmTextGenerator OnDevicePlanner`) shows `On-device plan did not satisfy the request: days=N/M, per-day=[…]` so the shape can be triaged.
- OOM → deterministic fallback (unchanged).

## 6. Log
- Log a set: exercise search, reps, weight, RIR, warm-up, bodyweight/blank weight, "per hand" hint.
- Recent-set quick-fill populates the fields; Delete removes a set.
- Sessions: first set auto-starts a session; End session / New session; day rollover starts a new one; active-session indicator correct.
- Backdated logging: picker opens, past time accepted, future time rejected, target session shown; row shows the backdated stamp.
- Units kg ↔ lb conversion correct.
- Planned-today focus matches the accepted plan; no accepted plan → no focus.
- Active block: the Logger's occurrence card shows the workout name and performed/prescribed sets; **Finish** is rejected until every prescribed set is recorded ("Not every prescribed set is recorded yet"), **Finish partially** resolves with the remainder omitted, and **Skip** resolves without inventing sets; the queue advances.
- **Load semantics (EX-02):** a bodyweight exercise hides the weight field (no numeric load); an addable bodyweight exercise reveals an "added load" field; a migrated legacy recent-set row reads "(recorded, unconfirmed)" and an added-load row reads "Bodyweight + X kg". A legacy planned draft requires resolving it as external or bodyweight before logging.

## 7. Fatigue
- Heatmap reflects logged sets per muscle; percentages shown; near-limit shows "99.9+%".
- Decay over time and reset at session boundaries behave as expected.

## 8. Personal records
- Add a manual PR; clear it; it seeds suggested weights on the next plan.

## 9. Settings
- Switch engine (only available engines listed), goal (Balanced/Strength/Hypertrophy/Endurance), units → each persists after relaunch.
- API key: save, shows "configured", clear.
- Model management: import/remove, target (NPU vs CPU/GPU) display, terms link.

## 10. Routines & scheduling
- Create a routine (name, workouts, exercises with sets/reps/weight); save; edit; reorder; duplicate; archive/restore; delete is blocked while a training block references it.
- Start a routine: chosen-weekday vs next-workout mode, start today vs a chosen date, previewed dates; confirm creates an active block with one pending occurrence per workout.
- Active block: pending/finished status, postpone a workout (reflows its unstarted suffix), change scheduling, repeat block, finish/cancel block.
- Plan tab: **Start block** starts the generated plan as a block (warns when one is already active), **Save as routine** copies it into a new routine.

## 11. Persistence & integrity
- Kill and relaunch → all data persists, including the active block and its occurrences.
- Optional: read-only DB pull (aggregates only) to confirm sessions/PRs were written.

## 12. Release-specific
- Install the signed APK from `release.yml`; `versionName`/`versionCode` match the tag/run number.
- Upgrade install over the previous build → data survives migrations.
